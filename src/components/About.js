          <SectionTitle>Our Story</SectionTitle>
          <SectionSubtitle>
            Founded by relationship psychologists and data scientists, Dating DNA emerged from a simple belief: understanding yourself is the first step to finding meaningful connections.
          </SectionSubtitle>
          
          <Paragraph>
            In today's fast-paced dating world, it's easy to get lost in endless swipes and superficial interactions. We saw that people were craving deeper, more meaningful connections, but they lacked the tools to understand what truly makes them compatible with others.
          </Paragraph>
          
          <Paragraph>
            That's why we created Dating DNA - a scientifically-backed platform that goes beyond surface-level attraction to help you understand your core personality traits, communication style, and relationship needs. Our assessment is built on decades of psychological research and validated through thousands of real relationships.
